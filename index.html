                <div class="section-content">
                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>Erbil SC was founded on 3 November 1968, by the former Kurdistan-Iraq Football
                         Association and spent many years in mid-table obscurity, occasionally 
                         challenging the top Iraqi sides.</p>
                         
                         <p>After the turn of the century and the beginning of 
                            the Iraq War, Erbil FC has dramatically improved and have become a real powerhouse in Iraqi club football.
                             Top Iraqi players from southern Iraq and international players from around the world have begun coming to the kurdistan
                             region and to Erbil SC to play their trade with good wages and relative safety.</p>
                            </div>
                             <h2>Nadhim Shaker and glory years</h2>

                             <p>In the summer of 2005, Shaker left rivals Duhok SC to coach Erbil. In the 2005-06 season,
                                 Erbil started slow, only just managing to finish third in Group A just ahead of Sirwan FC on goal difference to advance to the second round.
                                  Erbil topped their group in the second round to advance to the end of season play-offs where they met southern giants Najaf FC in a two-legged home and away tie. Erbil were beaten by Najaf by a 4-1 scoreline which basically dented all 
                                  hope of reaching the play-off final for the title. In the home leg, Erbil were winning 1-0 when the match got suspended with a replay taking place five days later with the match resulting in a 1-1 scoreline. 
                                  This meant Erbil were knocked out of a chance of winning the 
                                  championship but would instead take part in the third-place play-off match. This match didn't take place as in the other semi-final match between the two Baghdad giants, Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya and Al-Zawra'a. The second match of the leg was cancelled
                                   as the Al-Quwa players walked off the pitch,
                                   resulting in their disqualification and Erbil getting the automatic third-place finish.
                                 All in all, it was a strong first season under Shaker and that summer the team improved personnel ready for the next season.</p>
                                </p>

                                 <h2>Franso Hariri Stadium
                                </h2>

<p>Franso Hariri Stadium is the stadium where Erbil Sport Club play their home games. It is a multi-use stadium in Erbil. The stadium holds 25,000. It was built in 1992.

    After the assassination of Franso Heriri on 18 February 2001, who actively supported rebuilding the stadium, the Kurdistan Regional Government renamed it in his memory.
    
    In July 2009, Franso Hariri Stadium became Iraq national football team's home venue after the green-light from AFC to host the Iraqi national and clubs teams in Erbil.[2] However, due to technical problems,
     FIFA abandoned the idea of having more national games being hosted in the stadium.</p>

     <h2>Rivalries
    </h2>
<p>Erbil SC's main rival is Duhok SC with whom they contest the South Kurdistan derby. Also, the rivalry between Erbil SC and Zakho SC is known as the "Kurdish derby".[3] Within the Kurdish Premier League, they also have a Derby against Peshmerga Hawler SC, which is another club situated inside Erbil.</p>
